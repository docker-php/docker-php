Docker PHP
==========

**Docker PHP** (for lack of a better name) is a [Docker](http://docker.com/) client written in PHP. This library is still a work in progress. Not much is supported yet, but the goal is to reach 100% API support.

The test suite currently passes against the [Docker Remote API v1.17](http://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.17/).

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/docker-php/badge/?version=latest)](http://docker-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) [![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/stage1/docker-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stage1/docker-php) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/stage1/docker-php/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/stage1/docker-php/?branch=master)

Versioning
----------

There is no *stable* version yet and the API is rapidly evolving, but we still try to semantically version the library according to [semver](http://semver.org/), but shifted a little bit:

* **MAJOR** version number stays to 0 until API freeze
* **MINOR** version number is incremented when a backward incompatible change is made
* **PATCH** version number is incremented when a new feature is added

So basically, if you want the `0.5` version set, use a version constraint of `~0.5.0` and you should be fine.

We are **NOT** documenting upgrade procedures until we reach a stable API, please read the code and PRs to keep up with what's going on. You can also ask us for help, we're nice people!

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install Docker PHP is of course to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```json
{
    "require": {
        "stage1/docker-php": "@dev"
    }
}
```

**Note**: there is no stable version of Docker PHP yet.

Usage
-----

See [the documentation](http://docker-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Unit Tests
----------

Setup the test suite using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```
$ composer install --dev
```

Run it using [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/):

```
$ bin/phpunit
```

Contributing
------------

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work.

* You **MUST** follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/).
* You **MUST** run the test suite.
* You **MUST** write (or update) unit tests.
* You **SHOULD** write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before submitting your Pull Request.

One may ask you to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

Also, when creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you **MUST** write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.

Thank you!
