# Installation

The recommended way to install Docker PHP is of course to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

Run `composer require "stage1/docker-php":"@dev"` to add the dependency

or modify your composer.json manually:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "stage1/docker-php": "@dev"
    }
}
```


**Note**: there is no stable version of Docker PHP yet.
